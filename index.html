<h1>DOOCN-XVI: Workshop at CNS*2025</h1>
<h2>Population activity : the influence of cell-class identity, synaptic dynamics, plasticity and adaptation</h2>

<p class="location">
    The workshop will be held in presence. <a href="https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2025-meeting-program">link</a>

</p>

<p>The Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks (DOOCN) workshop series,
aims at exploring statistical dynamics on and off complex networks.
<em>Dynamics on networks</em> refers to the different types of
processes that take place on networks, like spreading, diffusion, and synchronization.
Modeling such processes is strongly affected by the topology
and temporal variation of the network structure,
i.e., by the <em>dynamics of networks</em>.</p>

In recent years tremendous developments have been achieved in the comprehension of neural activity 
at the population level. This has been possible on one side thanks to the new investigation methods 
recently developed (e.g. the neuropixels probes and large-scale imaging) that allows for the contemporary 
registration of the activity of (tens/hundreds of) thousands of neurons in alive and behaving mice as well as established dynamic-clamp protocols.
On the other side by the elaboration of extremely refined mean field models able to describe the population activity of spiking 
neural networks encompassing realistic biological features, from different forms of synaptic dynamics to plastic and adaptive aspects present at the neural level.
The aim of this workshop is to gather neuroscientists, mathematicians, engineers, and physicists all working on the 
characterization of the population activity from different point of views, ranging from data analysis of experimental 
results to simulations of large ensembles of neurons, from next generation neural mass models to dynamical mean field theories. 
This workshop will favour the exchanges and the discussion on extremely recent developments in this extremely fluorishing field.
This motivates us to focus on 
<strong>"Population activity : the influence of cell-class identity, synaptic dynamics, plasticity and adaptation."</strong>
as the topic of interest in the 2025 edition.</p>




<p>The 14<sup>th</sup> edition of the DOOCN workshop,
&ldquo;DOOCN-XVI: Population activity : the influence of cell-class identity, synaptic dynamics, plasticity and adaptation; will be held on <strong>July 8-9, 2025</strong> in conjunction with the upcoming
<a href="https://www.cnsorg.org/"> CNS*25 Florence -34^{th} Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting
</a> which will take place during 5&ndash; 9 July 2025, in Florence, Italy.

      <h4>Title: Balancing Excitation and Inhibition in connectivity and synaptic strength</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
     Maintaining a balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is fundamental for stable neuronal dynamics and proper brain function. 
     The efforts to maintain this balance are reflected in the conserved ratios of excitatory and inhibitory neurons across different brain regions and development. 
    I will discuss how neuronal networks with artificially altered E/I cell-count ratios can adapt by modifying their connectivity to restore the equilibrium.</p>

    At the level of synaptic strength, theoretical studies suggest that a combination of plasticity rules can drive the emergence of E/I co-tuning (detailed balance) 
    in neurons receiving independent, low-noise inputs. I will explore how recurrent network structures influence this process. Furthermore, at the level of single neurons 
    with complex morphologies, I will demonstrate how the spatial distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs across the dendritic tree affects both the stability  
   of learned orientation preference and the sharpness of tuning.</p>

      <h4>Title: Optimal control of neural activity in circuits with excitatory-inhibitory balance</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
    Excitatory-inhibitory balance governs how information is processed and transmitted through cortical circuits. 
    In this talk, we show how the input-output properties of a balanced circuit can be naturally explained by control theory. 
    We explain how excitatory-inhibitory interactions sculpt network controllability through the lens of balanced amplification. 
   We capture the spatiotemporal features of cell-type specific control in spatially extended networks by introducing two new observables: 
  controllability horizon and Gramian dimensionality. Extending these insights to networks trained on cognitive tasks, we highlight control 
  theory as a unifying principle for understanding both information processing and causal circuit manipulations.

      <h4>Title: Integration of rate and temporal codes by hippocampal cell-assemblies supports theta phase coding of task-relevant information</h4>
      <p>Abstract: 
        Spatial information is encoded by location-dependent hippocampal place cell firing rates and sub-second, 
        rhythmic entrainment of spike times. These rate and temporal codes have primarily been characterized in low-dimensional environments 
        under limited cognitive demands; but how is coding configured in complex environments when individual place cells signal several locations,
        individual locations contribute to multiple routes and functional demands vary? Quantifying CA1 population dynamics of male rats during a decision-making task, 
        we show that the phase of individual place cells\u2019 spikes relative to the local theta rhythm shifts to differentiate activity in different place fields. 
        Theta phase coding also disambiguates repeated visits to the same location during different routes, particularly preceding spatial decisions. 
        Using unsupervised detection of cell assemblies alongside theoretical simulations, we show that integrating rate and phase coding mechanisms dynamically recruits units to different assemblies, generating spiking sequences that disambiguate episodes of experience and multiplexing spatial information with cognitive context. </p>

      <h4>Title:  Integration of rate and phase codes by hippocampal cell-assemblies
supports flexible encoding of spatiotemporal context</h4>
      <p>Abstract: Spatial information is encoded by location-dependent hippocampal place cell
firing rates and sub-second, rhythmic entrainment of spike times. These ‘rate’ and
‘temporal’ codes have primarily been characterized in low-dimensional environments
under limited cognitive demands; but how is coding configured in complex
environments when individual place cells signal several locations, individual locations
contribute to multiple routes and functional demands vary? Quantifying rat CA1
population dynamics during a decision-making task, we show that the phase of
individual place cells’ spikes relative to the local theta rhythm shifts to differentiate
activity in different place fields. Theta phase coding also disambiguates repeated visits
to the same location during different routes, particularly preceding spatial decisions.
Using unsupervised detection of cell assemblies alongside theoretical simulation, we
show that integrating rate and phase coding mechanisms dynamically recruits units to
different assemblies, generating spiking sequences that disambiguate episodes of
experience and multiplexing spatial information with cognitive context.</p>

      <h4>Title: Linking hubness, embryonic neurogenesis, transcriptomics and diseases in human brain networks</h4>
      <p>Abstract: 
Understanding the architectural principles that shape human brain networks is a major
challenge for systems neuroscience. We hypothesize that the centrality of the different
brain circuits in the human connectome is a product of their embryogenic age, such that
early-born nodes should become stronger hubs than those born later. Using a human
brain segmentation based on embryogenic age, we observed that nodes’ structural
centrality correlated with their embryogenic age, fully confirming our hypothesis.
Distinct trends were found at different resolutions on a functional level. The difference
in embryonic age between nodes inversely correlated with the probability of existence
of links and their weights. Brain transcriptomic analysis revealed strong associations
between embryonic age, structure-function centrality, and the expression of genes
related to nervous system development, synapse regulation and human neurological
diseases. Our results highlight two key principles regarding the wiring of the human
brain, “preferential age attachment” and “the older gets richer”. In this talk, I will
especially focus and link some evidences from this model to the genetics,
transcriptomics and pharmacology relating to epilepsy and channelopathies. In
particular, we will focus on the GABAergic circuits' lesion induced by epilepsy and the
impact of the inhibition of the neuroinflammatory response via the JAK/STAT pathways.</p>

      <h4>Title: Nonlinear Time-series Analysis of MEA Recordings in cultured neuronal networks</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
      The brain is a complex system, characterized by many interacting regions with
      distinct identities and functionalities. Understanding differences, in electrophysiological activity 
      and connectivity among these regions, is crucial for gaining
      deeper insights into brain dynamics. In this work we studied neural cultures
      derived from mouse embryonic stem cells, focusing on their differentiation into
      three different brain regions: hippocampus, isocortex, and entorhinal cortex.
      Utilizing multi-electrode arrays (MEA) to record electrophysiological activity,
      we observed distinct behaviors among these networks. Specifically, entorhinal
      and isocortical networks exhibited critical behavior, leading to a synchronous
      activity, characterized by precise onsets within the network. Conversely, hippocampal 
      networks did not exhibit such behavior. We analyzed these features by
      considering the approach of self-organized criticality theory, characterizing the
      formation of neuronal avalanches. The analysis of avalanche size and duration
      distributions revealed differences between cultures. In particular, we observed
      two different behaviors, i.e. critical, characterized by power-law distributions,
      and subcritical, characterized by power-law with exponential cut-off distributions. 
      These behaviors depend on the activity synchronization level. Indeed,
      connectivity analysis highlights the disparity between critical networks displaying 
      high-level synchronization, and sub-critical ones displaying lower-level synchronization.</p>

      <h4>Title:  Synchronization of interconnected microgrids</h4>
      <p>Abstract: 
      Energy communities have been recently emerging as a concrete tool to accomplish the so-longed energy transition,
in an attempt to achieve social energy awareness, generation from renewable sources and new energy markets in a unique
framework [1]. This is not the first time that the idea of splitting current power grids into smaller building blocks has
been discussed in the recent years, as energy communities may be seen as a special case of microgrids - or virtual power
plants - which have already been largely investigated in the literature.
A rather neglected aspect is however what will be the task of the transmission grid in a future power network where most
of the energy exchanges (and thus, most of the power flows) will occur within microgrids, and less frequently there will be
energy exchanges among different communities. Indeed, it is expected that different microgrids will be owned by different
owners, and in addition to satisfying the internal energy requirements, they will be interested in maximizing their
revenues by selling the surplus energy to other communities.
This raises the problem of who should control the power flows, and who should regulate energy exchanges in order to maintain
a desired level of reliability of the overall power grid. 
In this talk we shall show the impact of energy exchanges between different microgrids, and we shall explain a simple
synchronization algorithm that can be utilized to orchestrate the functioning of the microgrids while maintaining a desired
quality of service of the power network (e.g., in terms of grid frequency). The talk is largely based on references [2]–[4].</p>
        
AIMD SYNCHRONIZATION</p>
  
The AIMD (Additive-Increase, Multiplicative-Decrease) algorithm has been widely utilized in the Internet congestion
control problem to optimally and fairly share bandwidth among connected users [5]. Similarly to the original problem,
here we assume that microgrids (MGs) gently increase in an additive fashion their probability to operate in a desired
“market mode” where they can sell power to other MGs. This scenario is known to increase frequency oscillations that may
be inconvenient for the power grid. Accordingly, when the  frequency starts assuming values that may be dangerous for the
safe operation of the power grid (denoted as “capacity event”), a multiplicative step occurs and the probability of operating
in “market mode” drops to a lower value. Conversely, more frequently the MGs operate in “ancillary mode” where they
start providing frequency regulation services.
In this fashion, the overall mechanism allows the MGs to maintain their operational freedom as much as possible (e.g.,
to increase their revenues by operating in the energy market), while mitigating the effect on the power grid. The advantages
of this solution are that it can be implemented in a fully decentralized fashion (each MG can measure the local frequency
at the point of connection of the MG with the grid), and that it can be also implemented in an unsyncrhonized way
to prioritize some MGs, if desired. In the last case, some MGs may have a larger or smaller probability to react to the
capacity event, so that some MGs may be selected with a larger probability to provide the required frequency regulation
services.</p>
  
CONCLUSIONS</p>
  
Appropriate synchronization strategies are required to orchestrate a large number of interconnected microgrids in a
transmission grid. If microgrids operate in an uncoordinated fashion, frequency stability issues may occur in the power
grid. Decentralized and flexible synchronization algorithms are attractive to guarantee autonomous managements and
operations of microgrids.</p>

      <h4>Title: A comparative analysis of different virtual inertia controllers in power grids with renewable energy
sources: effect on the stability </h4>
      <p>Abstract: Maintaining a synchronous state of generators is of central importance to standard operation in a power grid; indeed, a
loss of synchrony among power generators may cause the outages of power grids with cascading catastrophic failures,
as in the Western American network in 1996 [1]. The so-called inertia of the grid [2] is a measure of the power
system’s ability to counteract the frequency changes, i.e., to remain synchronized and stable when triggered by external
disturbances. Renewable energy sources (RESs) are interfaced with the grid through power converters without the intrinsic
inertia of synchronous machines, and their presence in power grids has recently increased [3], [4]. A strong presence of
RESs reduces the global inertia of the system, thus compromising its stability and reliability [5], [6]. For this reason,
it is fundamental to develop power converter controllers that provide synthetic inertia by mimicking the electro-mechanical
characteristic of a synchronous machine. In this talk, we investigate the performances of three different power converter
control techniques able to generate virtual inertia, namely grid-following with swing equation emulation [7], grid-forming
with swing equation emulation [8], and synchronverter [9].
The reference framework is a 3-bus system that comprises (i) a synchronous generator, serving as a grid equivalent, with a
rated power of 10 MW and a fixed inertia of 3s, (ii) a RES with a rated power of 1MW and variable inertia and (iii) a
time-varying load. The analysis focuses on the grid reaction to a rapid load increase; this sudden change allows analyzing
the grid stability and its capability to adapt to variable demand scenarios. In particular, we investigate how the virtual inertia
values provided by the three compared techniques and the physical distance d between the grid and the RES affect the
grid frequency and stability. The obtained results show that, by increasing d, the network can become unstable when the
grid-following control method is used.</p>

      <h4>Title: Chaos and Synchronization in the UJT relaxation oscillator </h4>
      <p>Abstract: Nonlinear electronic oscillators play an important role in a variety of electrical applications,
ranging from individual components to the modelling of networks and the development of power
grids. Additionally, the study of nonlinear oscillators can find many applications in other fields such
as geology, chemistry, and biology. A preeminent example is the use of nonlinear relaxation
oscillators for the modelling of neural spiking behaviour. Hence, understanding the collective
interaction and synchronization phenomena among these oscillators is essential, as evidenced by
important recent studies in this area [1-4].
In this work, we present the dynamical behaviour of a two-dimensional nonlinear relaxation
oscillator described by a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations.
In electronic circuits the presence of nonlinear active elements can enable the emergence of self-
sustained oscillations and in this context, the UJT (Uni Junction Transistor) can be employed to
construct relaxation oscillators where the junction acts as an electrically controlled switch that
allows the current to flow only after a triggering potential point.
In this circuit the UJT is connected to a capacitor and a load resistor, where the charge and the
current are measured. The resulting waveforms present two distinct time scales corresponding to
the charge and discharge of the capacitor and the impulsive current flowing through the resistor
creating a two-stroke oscillator.
In the work [5] a new mathematical model capable of satisfactory describe its behaviour was
presented. This continuous model reproduces the dynamics of the free oscillator, and when
subject to perturbation, it is capable of reproducing the observed complex dynamical behaviour,
such as the transition to chaos through the torus breakdown that was not properly described in
previous models of this system [6-7].
Finally, we explored synchronization phenomena by diffusively coupling a network of
oscillators and by employing Turing pattern formation techniques we assessed the stability
of the synchronized state in relation to its topological properties.</p>

      <h4>Title: Modeling and control of opinion dynamics in the presence of higher-order interactions</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
        We consider a group of N individuals that need to form an opinion on a two-option choice influenced by an opinion leader,
the individual N + 1. The i-th individual has opinion \(x_i\) , where \(x_i = 0\) means that individual i has a neutral opinion; \(x_i>0\) and
\(x_i < 0\) correspond, instead, to an individual leaning toward option 1 or 2, respectively, and higher values of \(|x_i|\) mean that the
opinion of the i-th agent is more extreme. The individuals are coupled through the hypergraph H=(V,E), whereby social
interactions are not only pairwise, but they can involve more than two agents at the same time. Namely, each hyperedge ε ∈ E
is a pair of ordered, disjoint subsets of V. The first subset, T(ε), contains the tails, and the second, H(ε), the heads of ε, with
the tail nodes trying to influence the opinion of the head nodes in the group interaction taking place on hyperedge ε. The opinion
dynamics of the i-th coupled agent is described by
$$ẋ_i = f (x_i , μ_i ) + ∑ σ_ε (x_ε^τ α_ε − x_ε^h β_ε ) + ∑ k_ε (x_{N+1} − x_ε^h β_ε ), i = 1, . . . , N,$$
whereas the opinion leader has dynamics \(ẋ_{N+1}=f(x_{N+1},μ_i)\), as it is not influenced by the other individuals; note that function
\(f(z,μ_i)=−3z+μ_itanhz\) is so that, when \(μ_i>3\), an isolated agent has an unstable equilibrium at the neutral opinion \(z=0\), and
two stable equilibria \(z=\pm\bar{x}_i\) leaning toward each of the two options [1]. The vectors αε and βε stack the weights of the tails and
heads of hyperedge ε, respectively, and are such that \(α_ε^T 1_{|T (ε)|} = β_ε^T 1_{|H (ε)|} = 1\), and the set \(E_{uc}^{∗,i} (E_p^{∗,i})\) is the set of hyperedges
not containing the opinion leader (containing the opinion leader) that have i as a head; \(x_ε^τ∈R^{|T (ε)|}\) and (x_ε^h ∈ R^{|H (ε)|}\) are row
vectors whose elements are the state of the agents that are tails and heads of hyperedge ε, respectively. Finally, for a hyperedge
\(ε∈E_{uc}\) , \(σ_ε\) is its coupling strength, and for \(ε ∈ E_p\) , \(k_ε\) is the control gain of the associated leader’s feedback control action.
We consider the case in which the hypergraph describing social interactions, extracted from [2], is divided into 15 communities
of 10 nodes each. The scope of the opinion leader is to bring the opinion of the followers as close as possible to its own.
However, in the presence of limited resources the leader can only decide to influence one of the 15 communities through directed
hyperedges. By linearizing equation (1) and using Lyapunov stability theory, we are able to identify the selection that yields the
smallest difference in norm between the opinion of the leader and that of the followers.</p>
