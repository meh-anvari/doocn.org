<p>The Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks (DOOCN) workshop series,
aims at exploring statistical dynamics on and off complex networks.
<em>Dynamics on networks</em> refers to the different types of
processes that take place on networks, like spreading, diffusion, and synchronization.
Modeling such processes is strongly affected by the topology
and temporal variation of the network structure,
i.e., by the <em>dynamics of networks</em>.

The science of complexity is a new and extremely trans-disciplinary field of research. Many
definitions have been given so far and yet the concept has resisted categorization, but,
nevertheless, becomes more and more attractive for many researchers in different fields. One of
the points of agreement among the scientists is that complex systems are those composed of a
large number of interacting elements, so that the collective behaviour of those elements goes
far beyond the simple sum of the individual behaviours. Initially the concept of complex
systems was mainly associated with the temporal evolution of systems made up of many
interacting units each characterized by highly nonlinear dynamics, prominent examples are
represented by spatio-temporal chaos or pattern forming systems.
In the last decades the interest has moved towards an even more intriguing subject: the
emergence of nontrivial collective dynamics in networks composed of elements whose evolution
is extremely simple, like oscillators with periodic dynamics. However, the interaction of identical
oscillators can lead, in spatially homogeneous system, to the emergence of nontrivial
macroscopic dynamics ranging from quasi-periodic to chaotic and 
states with broken spatial symmetry (the so-called ”chimera states”).
Starting from recent stimulating results, this workshop will be focused on interacting subpopulations of oscillators, 
with the goal of characterizing the dynamics both at the macroscopic
(collective) level, as well as at the level of each sub-population (mesoscopic level). Two
apparently quite distant research fields where the mesoscopic evolution of sub-networks is
extremely relevant are neural circuits and electrical power-grids. Sub-networks are naturally
present in power grids for renewable energy, where farms of different entity interact with the
network of consumers, and power generation is decentralized, geographically heterogeneous,
and strongly fluctuating. Several recent studies have demonstrated experimentally and
numerically that neuronal groups or ensembles (cliques), rather than individual neurons, are the
emergent functional units of cortical activity. Furthermore, mammalian cortical
neurons form transient oscillatory assemblies supporting temporal representation and long-term
consolidation of information in the brain. Theoretical methods and techniques developed for
coupled oscillators can be profitably applied in the context of neural networks and power-grids,
since these systems can be mathematically modelized as networks of coupled phase oscillators.

This motivates us to focus on 
<strong>"Dynamical Multiscale Engineering of Network Architecture"</strong>
as the topic of interest in the 2023 edition.</p>




<p>The 14<sup>th</sup> edition of the DOOCN workshop,
&ldquo;DOOCN-XV: Dynamical Multiscale Engineering of Network Architecture; will be held on <strong>July 22-23, 2024</strong> in conjunction with the upcoming
<a href="https://compeng2024.ino.cnr.it/"> Compeng2024 -2024 IEEE Workshop on Complexity in Engineering

      <h4>Title: Is the cortical dynamics ergodic?</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
Cortical neurons in vivo display significant temporal variability in their spike trains even in response to the same
stimulus. This variability is explained only in part by the intrinsic stochasticity of the spike-generation mechanism. In
fact, to account for the levels of variability observed in the experiment, one needs to assume additional fluctuations in
the level of activity over longer time scales [1]. But what is the origin of these fluctuations in the ”firing rates” ? Some
theories explain them as a result of precise adjustments of the synaptic connectivity [2]. According to an alternative scenario
slow fluctuations in the ”rates” are instead a signature of non-ergodicity [3], due to the partially-symmetric synaptic
connectivity, consistently with anatomical observations [4]. It is unclear, however, whether such ergodicity breaking occurs
also in spiking neural networks, due to the presence of fast temporal fluctuations in the synaptic inputs generated by the
spiking variability [5].
To address this question we study the dynamics of sparsely-connected networks of inhibitory quadratic-integrate-and-fire
(QIF) neurons [6], with arbitrary levels of symmetry, q, in the synaptic connectivity. The connectivity (i.e., adjacency)
matrix is random for q = 0 and fully symmetric for q =1. The neurons also receive a spatially-homogeneous, time-
constant excitatory drive, which is dynamically balanced by the recurrent synaptic inputs [6]. 
This results in low and heterogeneous average levels of activity across neurons, and temporally irregular spike trains,
mimicking prominent features of the activity observed in the cortex [7].
To investigate the ergodicity of the network dynamics, we estimate over time intervals, T , of increasing duration,
the single-neuron ”firing rates”, starting from different initial distribution of the membrane voltages (for the same network).
If the dynamics is ergodic, the difference D between the estimates obtained from different initial settings should go to
zero for suitably long time windows (i.e., as 1/T for sufficiently large T). This is, in fact, what happens in random networks
(i.e., q = 0). In partially symmetric networks q > 0, the onset of the ”ergodic” regime occurs at longer and longer
times. The situation becomes dramatic for the fully symmetric network (q=1), where D does not decay even for time windows
that are 5 order of magnitudes longer than the membrane time constant as shown in Fig 1 (c) (red solid line); the network
dynamics is non-ergodic, at least in a weak sense. In this regime, the network activity is sparse, with a large fraction of
almost-silent neurons, and the auto-covariance function of the spike trains exhibits long time scales, as routinely
observed in experimental recordings [8].
Our results support the idea that many features of cortical activity can be explained by the non-ergodicity of the network
dynamics [3]. In particular, in this regime, the activity level of the single neurons can significantly change depending
on the ”microscopic” initial conditions, providing a simple explanation for the large trial-to-trial fluctuations observed in
the experiment.</p>

      <h4>Title: Early warning signals for psychopathology</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
Many real-world phenomena share a common feature: the potential for sudden and difficult to reverse transitions into
less desirable states. This applies to a wide range of domains, from ecosystems to social structures [1]. The theory of
dynamical systems has identified early warning signals (EWSs) that can precede these so called “critical transitions,” enabling
intervention before the system becomes locked into an undesired state. Recently, mental health researchers have explored
the utility of EWSs for predicting transitions into unhealthy states (i.e. psychiatric disorders), which can be perceived as
alternative stable states opposed to the “healthy” ones. Notably, critical slowing down-based early warning signals have
exhibited potential as a predictive tool for identifying transitions into depression or other mental diseases. In this work, we
define \(x_i = [x_{i1} , . . . , x_{in} ]^T\) as the mental state of the individual i, with \(x_{ij}∈R\) being the variable associated to the j-th
symptom, emotion or transdiagnostic factor pertaining to the i-th individual. The mental health dynamics for individual i
are given by the following dynamical equation:
$$\dot{x}_{ij}=f_j(x_{ij} , x_{ij1} , . . . , x_{ijm} , u_i , w_i ),  j = 1, . . . , n;
 y_i = h(x_{i1}, . . . , x_{in}, ν_{ij} ), (1)$$
where \(j_1 , . . . , j_m\) are the neighbors of node j, i.e., the symptoms affecting the dynamics of symptom j; 
\(f_j\) describes how an individual’s mental state is influenced by their
own symptom history and the contextual factors in their environment, represented by the state of neighboring symptoms,
and by the “outside world” through the variable \(u_i∈R^m\). Note that \(f_j\) also depends on the random variable \(w_i∈R^q\),
which represents the uncertainty inherent in the model. This uncertainty arises from various sources, such as the complexity
of the underlying dynamics, and the inability to fully capture all the relevant factors affecting the symptoms within the
mathematical formalization. The variable \(y_i∈R^p\) corresponds to what we are actually able to measure of the overall mental
state of an individual, whereby we typically have p < n ; function h is a nonlinear function of the symptoms, and of a random
variable \(ν_{ij}∈R\), which represents the uncertainty that may arise from recall biases, subjective interpretation, distortions or
other influences that may affect the accuracy of the patient’s narration.
In practical applications, we are not aware of the functional form of fj and h, and only have at our disposal a multivariate
time-series \(y_i(1), . . . , y_i(T)\) of the noisy measured mental state of an individual. The objective is then that of an early
identification of the onset of critical transitions in an individual mental state, so to make an early detection, for instance, of
a crisis that is about to take place and change medications in a timely manner.
In this work, we compare two viable approaches for early warning, the kernel change point on running statistics, kcpRS
[3], and the time-varying change point autoregressive model of order 1, TVCP-AR(1) [4] on a case study of a 57 years-old
man with a history of major depression [2].</p>

      <h4>Title: Group ICA of wide-field calcium imaging data reveals the retrosplenial cortex as a major contributor to cortical
activity during anesthesia</h4>
      <p>Abstract: Large-scale cortical dynamics play a crucial role in many cognitive functions such as goal-
directed behaviors, motor learning and sensory processing. It is well established that
brain states including wakefulness, sleep, and anesthesia modulate neuronal firing and
synchronization both within and across different brain regions. However, how the brain
state affects cortical activity at the mesoscale level is less understood. This work aimed to
identify the cortical regions engaged in different brain states. To this end, we employed
group ICA (Independent Component Analysis) to wide-field imaging recordings of
cortical activity in mice during different anesthesia levels and the awake state. Thanks to
this approach we identified independent components (ICs) representing elements of the
cortical networks that are common across subjects under decreasing levels of anesthesia
toward the awake state. We found that ICs related to the retrosplenial cortices exhibited
a pronounced dependence on brain state, being most prevalent in deeper anesthesia
levels and diminishing during the transition to the awake state. Analyzing the occurrence
of the ICs we found that activity in deeper anesthesia states was characterized by a strong
correlation between the retrosplenial components and this correlation decreases when
transitioning toward wakefulness. Overall, these results indicate that during deeper
anesthesia states coactivation of the posterior-medial cortices is predominant over other
connectivity patterns, whereas a richer repertoire of dynamics is expressed in lighter
anesthesia levels and the awake state. </p>

      <h4>Title:  Integration of rate and phase codes by hippocampal cell-assemblies
supports flexible encoding of spatiotemporal context</h4>
      <p>Abstract: Spatial information is encoded by location-dependent hippocampal place cell
firing rates and sub-second, rhythmic entrainment of spike times. These ‘rate’ and
‘temporal’ codes have primarily been characterized in low-dimensional environments
under limited cognitive demands; but how is coding configured in complex
environments when individual place cells signal several locations, individual locations
contribute to multiple routes and functional demands vary? Quantifying rat CA1
population dynamics during a decision-making task, we show that the phase of
individual place cells’ spikes relative to the local theta rhythm shifts to differentiate
activity in different place fields. Theta phase coding also disambiguates repeated visits
to the same location during different routes, particularly preceding spatial decisions.
Using unsupervised detection of cell assemblies alongside theoretical simulation, we
show that integrating rate and phase coding mechanisms dynamically recruits units to
different assemblies, generating spiking sequences that disambiguate episodes of
experience and multiplexing spatial information with cognitive context.</p>

      <h4>Title: Linking hubness, embryonic neurogenesis, transcriptomics and diseases in human brain networks</h4>
      <p>Abstract: 
Understanding the architectural principles that shape human brain networks is a major
challenge for systems neuroscience. We hypothesize that the centrality of the different
brain circuits in the human connectome is a product of their embryogenic age, such that
early-born nodes should become stronger hubs than those born later. Using a human
brain segmentation based on embryogenic age, we observed that nodes’ structural
centrality correlated with their embryogenic age, fully confirming our hypothesis.
Distinct trends were found at different resolutions on a functional level. The difference
in embryonic age between nodes inversely correlated with the probability of existence
of links and their weights. Brain transcriptomic analysis revealed strong associations
between embryonic age, structure-function centrality, and the expression of genes
related to nervous system development, synapse regulation and human neurological
diseases. Our results highlight two key principles regarding the wiring of the human
brain, “preferential age attachment” and “the older gets richer”. In this talk, I will
especially focus and link some evidences from this model to the genetics,
transcriptomics and pharmacology relating to epilepsy and channelopathies. In
particular, we will focus on the GABAergic circuits' lesion induced by epilepsy and the
impact of the inhibition of the neuroinflammatory response via the JAK/STAT pathways.</p>

      <h4>Title: Nonlinear Time-series Analysis of MEA Recordings in cultured neuronal networks</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
      The brain is a complex system, characterized by many interacting regions with
      distinct identities and functionalities. Understanding differences, in electrophysiological activity 
      and connectivity among these regions, is crucial for gaining
      deeper insights into brain dynamics. In this work we studied neural cultures
      derived from mouse embryonic stem cells, focusing on their differentiation into
      three different brain regions: hippocampus, isocortex, and entorhinal cortex.
      Utilizing multi-electrode arrays (MEA) to record electrophysiological activity,
      we observed distinct behaviors among these networks. Specifically, entorhinal
      and isocortical networks exhibited critical behavior, leading to a synchronous
      activity, characterized by precise onsets within the network. Conversely, hippocampal 
      networks did not exhibit such behavior. We analyzed these features by
      considering the approach of self-organized criticality theory, characterizing the
      formation of neuronal avalanches. The analysis of avalanche size and duration
      distributions revealed differences between cultures. In particular, we observed
      two different behaviors, i.e. critical, characterized by power-law distributions,
      and subcritical, characterized by power-law with exponential cut-off distributions. 
      These behaviors depend on the activity synchronization level. Indeed,
      connectivity analysis highlights the disparity between critical networks displaying 
      high-level synchronization, and sub-critical ones displaying lower-level synchronization.</p>

      <h4>Title:  Synchronization of interconnected microgrids</h4>
      <p>Abstract: 
      Energy communities have been recently emerging as a concrete tool to accomplish the so-longed energy transition,
in an attempt to achieve social energy awareness, generation from renewable sources and new energy markets in a unique
framework [1]. This is not the first time that the idea of splitting current power grids into smaller building blocks has
been discussed in the recent years, as energy communities may be seen as a special case of microgrids - or virtual power
plants - which have already been largely investigated in the literature.
A rather neglected aspect is however what will be the task of the transmission grid in a future power network where most
of the energy exchanges (and thus, most of the power flows) will occur within microgrids, and less frequently there will be
energy exchanges among different communities. Indeed, it is expected that different microgrids will be owned by different
owners, and in addition to satisfying the internal energy requirements, they will be interested in maximizing their
revenues by selling the surplus energy to other communities.
This raises the problem of who should control the power flows, and who should regulate energy exchanges in order to maintain
a desired level of reliability of the overall power grid. 
In this talk we shall show the impact of energy exchanges between different microgrids, and we shall explain a simple
synchronization algorithm that can be utilized to orchestrate the functioning of the microgrids while maintaining a desired
quality of service of the power network (e.g., in terms of grid frequency). The talk is largely based on references [2]–[4].</p>
        
AIMD SYNCHRONIZATION</p>
  
The AIMD (Additive-Increase, Multiplicative-Decrease) algorithm has been widely utilized in the Internet congestion
control problem to optimally and fairly share bandwidth among connected users [5]. Similarly to the original problem,
here we assume that microgrids (MGs) gently increase in an additive fashion their probability to operate in a desired
“market mode” where they can sell power to other MGs. This scenario is known to increase frequency oscillations that may
be inconvenient for the power grid. Accordingly, when the  frequency starts assuming values that may be dangerous for the
safe operation of the power grid (denoted as “capacity event”), a multiplicative step occurs and the probability of operating
in “market mode” drops to a lower value. Conversely, more frequently the MGs operate in “ancillary mode” where they
start providing frequency regulation services.
In this fashion, the overall mechanism allows the MGs to maintain their operational freedom as much as possible (e.g.,
to increase their revenues by operating in the energy market), while mitigating the effect on the power grid. The advantages
of this solution are that it can be implemented in a fully decentralized fashion (each MG can measure the local frequency
at the point of connection of the MG with the grid), and that it can be also implemented in an unsyncrhonized way
to prioritize some MGs, if desired. In the last case, some MGs may have a larger or smaller probability to react to the
capacity event, so that some MGs may be selected with a larger probability to provide the required frequency regulation
services.</p>
  
CONCLUSIONS</p>
  
Appropriate synchronization strategies are required to orchestrate a large number of interconnected microgrids in a
transmission grid. If microgrids operate in an uncoordinated fashion, frequency stability issues may occur in the power
grid. Decentralized and flexible synchronization algorithms are attractive to guarantee autonomous managements and
operations of microgrids.</p>

      <h4>Title:A comparative analysis of different virtual inertia controllers in power grids with renewable energy
sources: effect on the stability </h4>
      <p>Abstract: Maintaining a synchronous state of generators is of central importance to standard operation in a power grid; indeed, a
loss of synchrony among power generators may cause the outages of power grids with cascading catastrophic failures,
as in the Western American network in 1996 [1]. The so-called inertia of the grid [2] is a measure of the power
system’s ability to counteract the frequency changes, i.e., to remain synchronized and stable when triggered by external
disturbances. Renewable energy sources (RESs) are interfaced with the grid through power converters without the intrinsic
inertia of synchronous machines, and their presence in power grids has recently increased [3], [4]. A strong presence of
RESs reduces the global inertia of the system, thus compromising its stability and reliability [5], [6]. For this reason,
it is fundamental to develop power converter controllers that provide synthetic inertia by mimicking the electro-mechanical
characteristic of a synchronous machine. In this talk, we investigate the performances of three different power converter
control techniques able to generate virtual inertia, namely grid-following with swing equation emulation [7], grid-forming
with swing equation emulation [8], and synchronverter [9].
The reference framework is a 3-bus system that comprises (i) a synchronous generator, serving as a grid equivalent, with a
rated power of 10 MW and a fixed inertia of 3s, (ii) a RES with a rated power of 1MW and variable inertia and (iii) a
time-varying load. The analysis focuses on the grid reaction to a rapid load increase; this sudden change allows analyzing
the grid stability and its capability to adapt to variable demand scenarios. In particular, we investigate how the virtual inertia
values provided by the three compared techniques and the physical distance d between the grid and the RES affect the
grid frequency and stability. The obtained results show that, by increasing d, the network can become unstable when the
grid-following control method is used.</p>

      <h4>Title: Chaos and Synchronization in the UJT relaxation oscillator </h4>
      <p>Abstract: Nonlinear electronic oscillators play an important role in a variety of electrical applications,
ranging from individual components to the modelling of networks and the development of power
grids. Additionally, the study of nonlinear oscillators can find many applications in other fields such
as geology, chemistry, and biology. A preeminent example is the use of nonlinear relaxation
oscillators for the modelling of neural spiking behaviour. Hence, understanding the collective
interaction and synchronization phenomena among these oscillators is essential, as evidenced by
important recent studies in this area [1-4].
In this work, we present the dynamical behaviour of a two-dimensional nonlinear relaxation
oscillator described by a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations.
In electronic circuits the presence of nonlinear active elements can enable the emergence of self-
sustained oscillations and in this context, the UJT (Uni Junction Transistor) can be employed to
construct relaxation oscillators where the junction acts as an electrically controlled switch that
allows the current to flow only after a triggering potential point.
In this circuit the UJT is connected to a capacitor and a load resistor, where the charge and the
current are measured. The resulting waveforms present two distinct time scales corresponding to
the charge and discharge of the capacitor and the impulsive current flowing through the resistor
creating a two-stroke oscillator.
In the work [5] a new mathematical model capable of satisfactory describe its behaviour was
presented. This continuous model reproduces the dynamics of the free oscillator, and when
subject to perturbation, it is capable of reproducing the observed complex dynamical behaviour,
such as the transition to chaos through the torus breakdown that was not properly described in
previous models of this system [6-7].
Finally, we explored synchronization phenomena by diffusively coupling a network of
oscillators and by employing Turing pattern formation techniques we assessed the stability
of the synchronized state in relation to its topological properties.</p>

      <h4>Title: Modeling and control of opinion dynamics in the presence of higher-order interactions</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
        We consider a group of N individuals that need to form an opinion on a two-option choice influenced by an opinion leader,
the individual N + 1. The i-th individual has opinion \(x_i\) , where \(x_i = 0\) means that individual i has a neutral opinion; \(x_i>0\) and
\(x_i < 0\) correspond, instead, to an individual leaning toward option 1 or 2, respectively, and higher values of \(|x_i|\) mean that the
opinion of the i-th agent is more extreme. The individuals are coupled through the hypergraph H=(V,E), whereby social
interactions are not only pairwise, but they can involve more than two agents at the same time. Namely, each hyperedge ε ∈ E
is a pair of ordered, disjoint subsets of V. The first subset, T(ε), contains the tails, and the second, H(ε), the heads of ε, with
the tail nodes trying to influence the opinion of the head nodes in the group interaction taking place on hyperedge ε. The opinion
dynamics of the i-th coupled agent is described by
$$ẋ_i = f (x_i , μ_i ) + ∑ σ_ε (x_ε^τ α_ε − x_ε^h β_ε ) + ∑ k_ε (x_{N+1} − x_ε^h β_ε ), i = 1, . . . , N,$$
whereas the opinion leader has dynamics \(ẋ_{N+1}=f(x_{N+1},μ_i)\), as it is not influenced by the other individuals; note that function
\(f(z,μ_i)=−3z+μ_itanhz\) is so that, when \(μ_i>3\), an isolated agent has an unstable equilibrium at the neutral opinion \(z=0\), and
two stable equilibria \(z=\pm\bar{x}_i\) leaning toward each of the two options [1]. The vectors αε and βε stack the weights of the tails and
heads of hyperedge ε, respectively, and are such that \(α_ε^T 1_{|T (ε)|} = β_ε^T 1_{|H (ε)|} = 1\), and the set \(E_{uc}^{∗,i} (E_p^{∗,i})\) is the set of hyperedges
not containing the opinion leader (containing the opinion leader) that have i as a head; \(x_ε^τ∈R^{|T (ε)|}\) and (x_ε^h ∈ R^{|H (ε)|}\) are row
vectors whose elements are the state of the agents that are tails and heads of hyperedge ε, respectively. Finally, for a hyperedge
\(ε∈E_{uc}\) , \(σ_ε\) is its coupling strength, and for \(ε ∈ E_p\) , \(k_ε\) is the control gain of the associated leader’s feedback control action.
We consider the case in which the hypergraph describing social interactions, extracted from [2], is divided into 15 communities
of 10 nodes each. The scope of the opinion leader is to bring the opinion of the followers as close as possible to its own.
However, in the presence of limited resources the leader can only decide to influence one of the 15 communities through directed
hyperedges. By linearizing equation (1) and using Lyapunov stability theory, we are able to identify the selection that yields the
smallest difference in norm between the opinion of the leader and that of the followers.</p>
