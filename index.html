<h1>DOOCN-XIV: Cascading Failures in Complex Networks</h1>

<p>The Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks (DOOCN) workshop series,
aims on exploring statistical dynamics on and of complex networks.
<em>Dynamics on networks</em> refers to the different types of
processes that take place on networks,
like spreading, diffusion, and synchronization.
Modeling such processes is strongly affected by the topology
and temporal variation of the network structure,
i.e., by the <em>dynamics of networks</em>.
Understanding and analyzing cascading failures in complex networks have been the focus of
  research for years. However, the complex interactions among the large number of components in these
  systems and their contributions to cascading failures are not yet completely understood.
 This motivates us to focus on
<strong>"Cascading Failures in Complex Networks"</strong>
as the topic of interest in the 2023 edition.</p>

<p>Understanding and analyzing cascading failures in complex systems is an important task.
As an
example, cascading failures in power grids can be defined as successive interdependent failures of
components in the system, which are usually initiated by few outages due to internal or exogenous
disturbances and are propagated in a relatively short period of time leading to large blackouts. While
large blackouts are infrequent, their occurrence still has substantial risks associated with the
significant economic losses and social impacts that they cause. Various studies and models have
been developed to understand and control these complex phenomena.
Cascading failures can also occur in computer networks (such as the Internet) in which network traffic
is severely impaired or halted to or between larger sections of the network, caused by failing or
disconnected hardware or software.
In finance, the risk of cascading failures of financial institutions is referred to as systemic risk: the
failure of one financial institution may cause other financial institutions to fail, cascading throughout
the system.
Biochemical cascades exist in biology, where a small reaction can have system-wide implications.
One negative example is ischemic cascade, in which a small ischemic attack releases toxins which kill
off far more cells than the initial damage, resulting in more toxins being released.
The vast application of the concept of cascading failures motivates us to focus on this specific
following theme this year.


<p>The 14<sup>th</sup> edition of the DOOCN workshop,
&ldquo;DOOCN-XIV: Cascading Failures in Complex Networks; will be held on <strong>August 28-29, 2023</strong> in conjunction with the upcoming
<a href="https://statphys28.org/">STATPHYS28 2023</a> conference
which will take place during 7&ndash;11 August 2023, in Tokyo, Japan although the workshop will be held online.

      <h4>Title: Complex Coupling Formulations for Power Grid Dynamics</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
      Collective phenomena like synchronization underpin the function of the power grid. I
present a new and surprising formulation of the physics of the grid in terms of the coupling
between nodes. This resembles an adaptive network formulation and enables an elegant
analysis of the full systems dynamics. Using this formulation I present a new proof of concept
quasi-local control law for power grids that guarantees synchronization. I will also present
initial results on empirically derived complex oscillator models for the future grid in this
approach.</p>

      <p>Abstract: A large amount of experimentally measured data is now available
to analyse the statistics of power grid frequency deviations from 50Hz and to
understand their dynamical behaviour. I briefly present superstatistical models
that can be used in this context. I will then discuss the propagation speed
of  local  perturbations in the grid, including both large-scale propagation of a
given perturbation as well frequency differences on much smaller scales.

      <h4>Title: Sampling vulnerable power grid networks using MCMC</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
The transition to the exclusive use of renewable energy sources poses a
difficult problem for the electricity grid, as the states of the grid
become more variable and unpredictable, possibly leading to states
vulnerable to cascading failures. Here we want to address this problem
by using Marcov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to generate and
analyze ensembles of vulnerable states. This allows us to better
understand and even predict such states from the input patterns alone.
We find that more clustered generators and consumers lead to larger
failure cascades and non-local first outages are an early warning sign for unfolding large cascades.</p>

      <h4>Title: Cascading Failures and Critical Infrastructures in Future Renewable Power Systems</h4>
      <p>Abstract: Mitigating the effects of climate change by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases is the
key challenge of the coming decades. To this end, the world’s power systems are undergoing a
rapid transformation, shifting away from carbon-intensive power generation by thermal power
plants to renewable power sources, which is mainly provided by wind and solar power
generation.
As a result, there is a growing importance of long-distance power transmission, while the
intrinsic system inertia provided by thermal power plants decreases. This poses several
challenges to the system such as an accelerated dynamics and a higher loaded power grid,
which might lead to a higher control effort to keep the system operating within safe margins.
These developments make power grids more vulnerable to cascading failures, which may result
in a splitting of the grid and eventually in a large-scale blackout. A system split is one of the
worst contingencies a power system can experience as it results in the power system being
separated into several desynchronized components. This might have far reaching
consequences for the power system like, for instance, the system split in November of 2006 that
left millions of people without electricity. While such large system splits are rare, several smaller
splits were observed in recent years, which underlines the need to understand how these
system splits can occur and what their impact is.
In this work, we use the state-of-the-art open energy system model PyPSA to generate future
energy systems for different carbon reduction targets. Subsequently, we trigger line failures to
investigate the likelihood of cascading failures that lead to systems splits in the European power
grid. We determine which splits are most likely and dangerous to highlight their impact on the
European power system. Additionally, we identify critical infrastructure elements, i.e.,
transmission lines that either trigger a system split or are involved in a cascade that leads to a
system split. Understanding how the triggers, impact, and likelihood of system splits change for
future renewable power systems, is a first step towards finding mitigation strategies that
guarantee safe and reliable power systems.</p>

      <h4>Title: Sandpile cascades on oscillator networks: the BTW model meets Kuramoto</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
Cascading failures abound in complex systems, and the BTW sandpile model
provides a theoretical underpinning for their analysis. Yet, it does not account for the possibility
of nodes having oscillatory dynamics, such as in power grids and brain networks. We will
consider a network of Kuramoto oscillators upon which the BTW model is unfolding, enabling
us to study how the feedback between the oscillatory and cascading dynamics can lead to new
emergent behaviors. We assume that the more out-of-sync a node is with its neighbors, the
more vulnerable it is and lower its load-carrying capacity accordingly. And when a node
topples and sheds load, its oscillatory phase is reset at random. This leads to novel cyclic
behavior at an emergent, long timescale. The system spends the bulk of its time in a
synchronized state where the load builds up with minimal cascades. Yet, eventually, the
system reaches a tipping point where a large cascade triggers a "cascade of larger cascades,”
which can be classified as a Dragon King event. The system then undergoes a short transient
back to the synchronous build-up phase. The coupling between capacity and synchronization
gives rise to endogenous cascade seeds in addition to the standard exogenous ones, and we
will show their respective roles.</p>

      <h4>Title: Cascading failures in power grids: Physical insights and robust grid structures</h4>
      <p>Abstract: Cascading failures are the biggest threat for the stability of electric power systems: Large
        blackouts can typically be traced back to the failure of a single transmission element. In my talk I will
        analyze the spreading of cascades from the perspective of theoretical physics and network science. The
        main question is: Given the failure of a single transmission line, how do power flows change and where
        are secondary failures most likely? Based on this analysis, I discuss specific structural features that
        make a network more robust to transmission line failures. We show that the spreading of a cascade between
        different parts of a network can be large suppressed by an appropriate design.</p>

      Invited Talk by <strong>Pere Colet</strong>
      <h4>Title: Blackout risk reduction by segmenting large power grids with controllable HVDC
lines</h4>
      <p>Abstract: Large electrical transmission networks are susceptible to undergo very large blackouts
        due to cascading failures, with a very large associated economical cost. We analyze the effect of
        segmenting large power grids using controllable lines, such as high-voltage direct-current lines,
        to reduce the risk of blackouts. During a blackout, the power flowing through these lines is controlled
        in order to minimize the load shed. As a result, the segmented grids have a substantially lower risk
        of blackouts than the original network. The control method is shown to be specially efficient in reducing
        blackouts affecting more than one zone. As a case study we consider the continental European grid with
        two possible segmentations: one through the Pyrenees separating the Iberian peninsula from the rest of
        Europe and the other dividing the network in approximately two halves, Eastern and Western Europe.</p>

      <h4>Title:  Reconstruction of cascading failures in dynamical models of power grids</h4>
      <p>Abstract: In this talk we propose a method to reconstruct the active links of a power network described by
        a second-order Kuramoto model and subject to dynamically induced cascading failures. Starting from the
        assumption (realistic for power grids) that the structure of the network is known, our method reconstructs
        the active links from the evolution of the relevant dynamical quantities of the nodes of the system, that is,
        the node phases and angular velocities</p>

      <h4>Title: Assessing the Ability of Graph Neural Networks to Predict Power Outages of
Cascading Failures In a Power Grid</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
      Cascading power failures are a serious problem in the operation of power grids.
These failures can lead to significant economic losses, social disruption, and even loss of life.
Predicting the occurrence of cascading power failures and their extent is essential for
power grid operators to take appropriate preventive and corrective actions. Recently,
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in solving complex problems
related to graph-structured data. This Presentation aims to assess the ability of GNNs to
predict power outages resulting from cascading failures in a power grid.</p>

      <h4>Title: Influence of Complex Networks on Ride-Pooling Systems</h4>
      <p>Abstract:
Ride-pooling is an efficient technique to lower negative aspects of individual traffic by cars
like CO2-emissions or noise. Ride-pooling services bundle similar rides together, implying that the
number of required vehicles and the overall number of rides decreases in the service area. Since the
necessary infrastructure is already in place, ride-pooling can be implemented quickly. It can work as
door-to-door service or use stops. However, since studies show that the first case is inefficient, we
work with discrete stop networks.
Here we study, which stop networks perform the best at minimizing the average passenger travel time
ts. To draw the most efficient networks from the infinite set of possible networks that can be created
on every road network, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (MCMC) is used. Starting from an initial network, in each step of the MCMC, a proposal network is generated from the
last accepted network by pooling or splitting stops. The efficiency of a network is determined by
evaluating ts from a ride-pooling simulation. The proposed network is then accepted with a
probability, ensuring more efficient networks are always accepted, while less efficient ones only have
a small acceptance probability. In the result networks, stops at intersections are preferred. Stops that lead to detours are ignored
and the area served by the system is reduced. Furthermore, it can be deduced from the result
networks that the average travel time can be approximated from the networks themselves.</p>
